    <h2>Tim</h2>
    <p>Hello!  I am a software engineering student.  I work too much to have a hobby.</p>  
    <p>I am married.  We have 7 children.  4 children are married.  There are grandchildren.</p>  
    <p>I work as a broadcast engineer.  I am preparing for retirement.</p>  
    <p>I have been a member of the church all of my life.  Presidnet Kimball had this on his desk, "Just Do It!"  I take it to mean just live the gospel.  It makes all the difference.</p>
